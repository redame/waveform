## Genepipe

_Genepipe_ is a module created specifically for this application to manage data sources and computation pipeline.  The module itself is designed to be generalised, i.e. it doesn't contain anything specific to this applciation, but it's design is entierly tuned for the needs of this application.

This document explains the structure of _genepipe_ using examples from the main application.

The idea is that the tilewall and individual tiles in the grabbed panel are _organisms_.  All _organisms_ share the same basic _genome_, but they can have different _alleles_ for each _gene_ and they may omit _genes_ if they wish. Note that _allele_ isn’t quite the right term as the value of many of the _alleles_ is not fixed; think of each _allele_ as a distinct version of their _gene_, but one that can evolve over time without losing its original _allele_-identity.  Given that _alleles_ can change, we have to refer to the _value_ of an _allele_ at a given time, this _value_ data is treated as being immutable, meaning that when we want to change it we have to create a copy, modify the copy and then assign the copy back to the _allele_ as its new _value_.   

The _genome_ defines a non-circular set of dependencies between _genes_.  The _genepool_ contains the various _alleles_ in existence for each _gene_.  Some of the _alleles_ are treated as _sources_, meaning that they have no dependencies; this could mean that according to the _genome_, the _allele_’s _gene_ never has any dependencies, or it could mean that this particular _allele_ has been purposefully orphaned from its dependencies, so as to leave its _value_ frozen going forward. Note that some _source_ _alleles_ may evolve over time (as stated earlier), while others will never change (e.g. file _alleles_ dont change, but a mask or cut _allele_ might be altered by the user) . The second type of _allele_ is the _compute_ _allele_; these derive their values from the _alleles_ that they depend on (according to the _genome_), using the _update_ function defined for the given _gene_, within the _genome_ (they will thus be liable to change like the cut/mask _source alleles_ do).  The _genome_ defines a _render_ function for some of the _genes_, which _alleles_ can use when their _value_ changes - they hold a list of the _contexts_ required for rendering, one for each of the _organisms_ with that _allele_.
